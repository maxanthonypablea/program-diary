# The Starting Point
Hi! I'm Max Anthony and I work as a coder/ junior programmer & devsec-op which I handle different software projects and technologies. I graduated from a private Christian school here in the Philippines (NCR) as a scholar in which I enrolled for 2 years and a half. I was once living a simple life and living for a simple dream but I never expected to be part of shadow government experiments for psychological warfare developed since 1973. 

It all started from my biking journey going back and forth in NCR, My motive was to go on Batanes to unwind. My mind was changed when I reached Dagupan after some break and realized that I should go home. That moment at the exact time when I reached Sorsogon, I realized and never expect that I've been already subjected to the experiment since I was a kid for the shadow government project called `the program`. This program is all about psychological warfare in which you will be monitored by different agents through mass surveillance (breaking your digital privacy), reading your mind on how you react in different emotions and reading brain wave activities which is compared and analyzed for brain mapping purposes. I was so confused and shock, after the research I found on the internet which has given me to realize that this kind of experiment are already adapted by different government agencies that are considered as third world countries.
