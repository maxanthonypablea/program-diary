# Lost Sheep : Chapter 04
I was lost in the middle of Pasig City, nowhere to go and nowhere to hide, The perps are everywhere following my path on the highway it is odd to see those tons of motorcycles with full gear suites, maybe it is for protection due to the corona pandemic but the first thing I notice was the firetruck that I thought it was keeping the alarm to let me know that they are around, In this situation, I am currently harrassed through street theaters that I encountered along the highway and hearing different gender of voices pertained for my trauma through threats that I have experienced at that time and it was like between life and death and fully unaware to what is going on while walking barefoot with no extra clothes to wear and my own last short that I wear have been torn near in my ass. 

I'm still confused at that moment looking for places somewhere to sleep, somewhere to eat and drink clean water while lots of people see me as a mad man in the middle of the street. After 3 days of survival through begging for food and drinks while walking in street, I found hope to live and fight after this old man in the station noticed me looking for CR, He has given me clothes, a towel, and a bag with bottled water which is enough for my journey to reach my destination in a private location. Some people that I meet along the road giving me a small amount of money just to get on the bus. While inside the bus I have these thoughts in my mind questioning myself, "Does the government know about this?, Does the media noticed me? Are things still under control? Am I living in a simulated fantasy world also known as a matrix? Who are these people? I know that I am innocent and not involved in any scandals but why me?".

One of the most unforgettable things that I have noticed that there are 3 black helicopters that look like apache used by Americans and one white unknown helicopter and an unknown airplane following me in different places except for those black helicopters. That's what I'm going to find out when I reach my private location destination.
