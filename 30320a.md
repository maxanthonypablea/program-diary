# The Paranoia : Chapter 02
I came from Bicol Region due to quarantine issues and now going back to Manila because of a lack of requirements and other issues for the RO-RO(roll on roll off) ship. In both of these places, I experienced street theatres causing traffic in EDSA and tons of people occupying small spaces that look like freaking tuna in small areas. Imagine a group of different cars, trucks, and motorcycles with weird id nameplates for example (BNANA-434), (KKASS-328) so weird right?. 

I have seen tons of people looking at their phones directly after they saw me in different parts of the streets updating my locations through the messenger app. Within those days I'm so confused and don't know what to do after I run away from the place called Palo alto Rizal, Antipolo, Within that place I experienced great fear due to the voices that I heard threats. I biked with a great amount of fear without my slippers and bag having tons of mads splashing in my feet and face because of the sounds that I hear at 1:00 AM - 3:00 AM. The worst part of it was the voice that I heard is already telling me that he always watching me through reading my mind and he feels the way I feel. The more I bike going back in Quezon City I smell different kinds of fragrance on the highway, The fragrance of newborn mango sprayed by pesticide and fragrance used by the morgue. Luckily I survived but was exhausted and tired due to sleep deprivation because the voice was telling me about the sniper aimed at my sitting position and lastly hunger.
