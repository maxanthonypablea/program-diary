# Slave Entrapment : Chapter 03
I was wandering and walking around while tons of perps are following me and different kinds of people that approach seem to know me for a reason, It's like living in a world of simulation controlled by the voices giving you a huge amount of trauma through fears in  Quezon City.

The worst part of voices that I've heard is when they can manipulate different sound waves like a building or a poster can speak directly to you telling about orders and telling different things that the people around me can read my subconscious mind which is uncontrollable and the worst part of all ordering me to shout that I was an NPA (New Peoples Army) Musang or involved from their group or activities in the middle of Ortigas and Unknown area in Quezon City.

All of it was to convert my mind through brainwashing, lots of people know that I'm a law-abiding citizen and just a new graduate student and desperate to go home but series of unfortunate events happened. I never expect to experience this in my whole life giving me traumas and fear. Sometimes I think about going to another country and leaving my own beloved country.
